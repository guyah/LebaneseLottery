# Lebanese Lottery Project

The goal of this project is to assess the fairness of the Lebanese Lottery system.

And maybe also, provide higher probability to a sequence of numbers which are to come.
The Scrapper script saves all of the draws into a csv file (use it as you like)
I also made a copy of the dataset from the day I uploaded this repo.

Mainly, it's a learn and apply project.
I am mainly interested in 3 things:
1. The actual fairness
2. Assessing the best model to predict randomized data.
3. Data science obviously.
