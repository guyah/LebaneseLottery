# Lebanese Lottery Project

The goal of this project is to assess the fairness of the Lebanese Lottery system.
And maybe also, predict the holy grail (the next numbers), or provide higher probability numbers which are to come.
The Scrapper script saves all of the draws into a csv file (use it as you like)
I also have a copy of the dataset from the day I uploaded this repo.

Mainly, it's a learn and apply project.
I am mainly interested in 2 things:
1. The actual fairness
2. Assessing the best model to predict randomized sets.
3. Data science obviously.


If any though comes into your mind make sure to either send it by email: guyabihanna@gmail.com
or comment it on Kaggle!
